Why Parse JSON on the GenAI End?
LLM-Friendly Structure:
The input (TranscriptRequest) and output (prediction JSON) are structured specifically for LLM-based classification (like Azure OpenAI or local LLMs). It makes sense to handle data shaping here.

FastAPIâ€™s Native Support:
Python + FastAPI has built-in support for reading and responding with JSON. This makes parsing, validating, and manipulating JSON very easy with pydantic models like TranscriptChunk.

Keep C++ Lean:
Let the C++ backend focus on lower-level tasks like triggering a scan, handling performance-critical code, or streaming. Offload high-level parsing/logic to the Python side where it's easier and faster to iterate.

Decouple Logic:
Keeping parsing in GenAI allows you to:

Reuse the endpoint with any client (not just C++).

Easily debug/test using Postman, curl, or browser.
